\\textbf{{\\textcolor{{darkblue}}{{Subject: Application for {job_title} Position}}}}

Dear Hiring Manager,

{intro}

In my current position, I have been leading infrastructure optimization projects and implementing cost-effective solutions, including migrating from Azure Kubernetes Service to local Kubernetes clusters. My experience spans the entire technology stack, and I have successfully built microservices architectures, implemented RESTful APIs, and managed complex database integrations across SQL and NoSQL platforms.

What particularly excites me about {company} is your commitment to innovative technology solutions. My background in automotive technology at ECARX, combined with my freelance work developing cloud-native applications at Synteda, has given me valuable experience in building scalable, enterprise-level applications.

My recent hobby projects demonstrate my passion for {role_focus} development: developing the Gothenburg TaxiCarPooling platform with Spring Boot and React Native, building SmartTV applications for Android Auto, and creating a comprehensive e-commerce platform. These projects showcase my ability to work with modern technologies and deliver end-to-end solutions.

I am particularly drawn to opportunities where I can combine my technical skills with my experience in agile methodologies and cross-functional collaboration. My certifications in AWS Solutions Architecture and Azure Fundamentals, along with my practical project experience, position me well to contribute immediately to your development initiatives.

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my experience in {role_focus} development can contribute to {company}'s continued success. Thank you for considering my application.

\\vspace{{20pt}}

Best regards,

Hongzhi Li

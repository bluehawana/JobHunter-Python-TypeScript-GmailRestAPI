# üîó LinkedIn API Setup Guide

## Your Current Status
‚úÖ **LinkedIn Client ID**: `77duha47hcbh8o` (already configured)  
‚ùå **LinkedIn Client Secret**: Not provided yet  
‚ùå **LinkedIn Access Token**: Not provided yet  

## Step 1: Get LinkedIn API Credentials

1. **Go to LinkedIn Developers**
   - Visit: https://www.linkedin.com/developers/apps
   - Sign in with your LinkedIn account

2. **Find Your Existing App**
   - Look for an app with Client ID: `77duha47hcbh8o`
   - If it doesn't exist, create a new app

3. **Get Client Secret**
   - In your app dashboard, go to "Auth" tab
   - Copy the "Client Secret" value

4. **Get Access Token**
   - In the "Auth" tab, find "Access Token" section
   - Generate or copy your access token
   - Make sure it has "r_liteprofile" and "r_emailaddress" permissions

## Step 2: Set Environment Variables

Once you have the credentials, set them:

```bash
export LINKEDIN_CLIENT_SECRET="your_actual_client_secret_here"
export LINKEDIN_ACCESS_TOKEN="your_actual_access_token_here"
```

## Step 3: Test the Integration

Run the LinkedIn integration:

```bash
export SMTP_PASSWORD='pvfpejpkrbknqbpj' && \\
export ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL='https://anyrouter.top' && \\
export ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN='sk-wldqMp1L48Uh85iQWgv05sRuUgtZxqyJAH92mW476z0SyiG4' && \\
export LINKEDIN_CLIENT_SECRET='your_secret' && \\
export LINKEDIN_ACCESS_TOKEN='your_token' && \\
python3 linkedin_real_integration.py
```

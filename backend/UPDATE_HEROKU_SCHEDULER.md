# Update Heroku Scheduler Guide

## ðŸŽ¯ Current Situation
You have a Heroku scheduler job running `schedule_6am_email_scan.sh` daily at 6:00 AM UTC.

## âœ… Recommended Action: Update Existing Job

**Update your existing scheduler job** rather than creating a new one to use the new master automation orchestrator.

### Option 1: Keep Same Script Name (Recommended)
Your existing `schedule_6am_email_scan.sh` has been updated to use the master orchestrator. 

**No changes needed in Heroku dashboard** - just redeploy:

```bash
# Deploy the updated script
git add .
git commit -m "Update scheduler to use master automation orchestrator"
git push heroku main
```

The existing scheduler will automatically use the updated script on the next run.

### Option 2: Use New Script Name
If you prefer to use the new script name for clarity:

1. **In Heroku Dashboard:**
   - Go to your app â†’ Resources â†’ Heroku Scheduler
   - Click "Edit" on your existing job
   - Change the command from:
     ```bash
     bash schedule_6am_email_scan.sh
     ```
   - To:
     ```bash
     bash schedule_6am_complete_automation.sh
     ```
   - Save the changes

2. **Deploy the new script:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add new complete automation scheduler script"
   git push heroku main
   ```

3. **Generate professional PDFs** for each job
4. **Send applications** to hongzhili01@gmail.com
5. **Create detailed summary** of the execution
6. **Log everything** for monitoring

## ðŸŽ¯ Recommendation

- âœ… No Heroku dashboard changes needed
- âœ… Maintains your existing schedule
- âœ… Automatic upgrade on next deployment
- âœ… Same 6 AM daily execution
- âœ… Enhanced functionality with same interface

Just deploy the changes and your automation will be upgraded! ðŸš€

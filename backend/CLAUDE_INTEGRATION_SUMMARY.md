# Claude API Integration with LEGO System - COMPLETE âœ…

## What We've Accomplished

### ðŸ§  Claude as the LEGO Decision Maker
- **Claude analyzes each job** and decides which LEGO components to use
- **Claude determines focus**: DevOps, Backend, Frontend, or Fullstack based on job requirements
- **Claude selects skills** to highlight based on job description keywords
- **Claude tailors content** to match company culture and role requirements

### ðŸŽ¯ LEGO Component Strategy
Claude now decides:
1. **Primary Focus**: What role positioning to use (devops/backend/frontend/fullstack)
2. **Skills to Highlight**: Which technical skills to emphasize most
3. **Experience Order**: Which job experience should lead (ECARX vs Synteda)
4. **Profile Angle**: How to position Hongzhi for the specific role
5. **Keywords to Include**: Key terms from job description to integrate naturally
6. **Sections to Emphasize**: Which resume sections need more detail
7. **Tone**: Professional tone to match company culture

### ðŸ’Œ Cover Letter Soft Skills Focus
Claude creates cover letters that emphasize:
- **Cross-cultural bridge building** (Chinese-Swedish perspective)
- **Business-IT translation** (Master's in International Business + Tech)
- **Cultural adaptability** and global mindset
- **Multilingual communication** abilities
- **International team collaboration** experience
- **Unique value propositions** not covered in CV

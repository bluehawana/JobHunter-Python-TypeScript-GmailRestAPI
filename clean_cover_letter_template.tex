% Salutation
Dear Hiring Manager,

% Letter body
I am writing to express my passionate interest in the JOB\_TITLE role at COMPANY\_NAME. As a current COMPANY\_NAME team member in IT/Infrastructure, I am excited about this internal opportunity to channel my deep automotive passion into developing next-generation Android-based infotainment solutions.

My expertise in Android development with Kotlin and Java, combined with 5+ years of mobile application experience, directly aligns with the requirements. I have hands-on experience with Android SDK, platform architecture, and key components including Activities, Services, Content Providers, and Broadcast Receivers. While I have experience in our Azure cloud migration to on-premise data center project, focusing heavily on CI/CD optimization and performance tuning. Through this work, we achieved our fastest Android AOSP 15 clean build time of 7.5 minutes - the best we've ever recorded. This experience with build system optimization and performance tuning, combined with my commitment to learning C++ for native development, gives me confidence that I can master AOSP development and contribute effectively to native platform software development.

What sets me apart is my genuine passion for automotive infotainment innovation, demonstrated through personal projects that could enhance COMPANY\_NAME's competitive advantages. I've developed a Kotlin Car TV Player with seamless TV media streaming, an Android Auto eBook Reader with hands-free and STT integration, and a Car Voice AI Bot featuring custom wake-word detection and AI-driven responses. These projects showcase my vision for intelligent, adaptive infotainment systems that learn driver preferences and provide contextually relevant experiences while maintaining automotive standards.

My unique strength lies in bridging cultural and technical gaps. Fluent in both English and Mandarin, I excel at facilitating collaboration between diverse teams and translating complex technical concepts into business value. My international business background enables me to understand market demands while my technical expertise ensures innovation that aligns with user expectations.

I am particularly excited about contributing to COMPANY\_NAME's sustainable development mission. I envision developing energy-efficient infotainment algorithms that optimize system performance to extend vehicle range, creating new user experiences that highlight EV benefits, and implementing intelligent features that differentiate our products in the competitive automotive market.

My experience with clean code practices, cross-functional collaboration, troubleshooting, and performance optimization positions me to contribute immediately to our Android development processes while participating in code reviews and promoting best practices. I am comfortable working with AI tools to accelerate development and have a valid driver's license for in-vehicle testing and validation.

Thank you for considering my application for this internal opportunity. I am enthusiastic about transitioning my role within COMPANY\_NAME to focus on infotainment software development, where I can transform my automotive passion into professional impact and contribute to our company's leadership in next-generation automotive solutions.

\opening{Dear Hiring Manager,}

I'm writing to express my strong interest in the Full Stack Engineer (Frontend-Oriented) role at DoiT International. For the past five years, I've been immersed in full-stack development, with a particular passion for crafting intuitive and performant React-based frontends. My current role at ECARX involves building real-time monitoring dashboards and contributing to our cloud infrastructure, which has given me invaluable experience with AWS, Azure, and GCP - especially around cost optimization and management. The opportunity to leverage that experience at a company like DoiT, focused on cloud intelligence, is incredibly exciting.

The integration of Cloudwize security engines into DoiT Cloud Intelligence is a problem I'd love to tackle. I've architected and built React interfaces, designed RESTful and GraphQL APIs, and gained a deep understanding of the challenges involved in optimizing cloud costs and ensuring robust security. My personal projects, like SmrtMart (a Go/Next.js e-commerce platform) and my weather platform (built with Spring Boot and React), demonstrate my commitment to building scalable and user-friendly applications. Plus, Mibo.se (C#/React/Azure), a project I worked on previously, allowed me to hone my skills in the Microsoft cloud ecosystem.

I'm also a huge advocate for remote work, having thrived in international environments (including Swedish and Chinese-speaking teams) for years. I'm confident in my ability to collaborate effectively, communicate clearly, and contribute meaningfully to a distributed team. I'm eager to dive into DoiT's remote-first culture and contribute to your mission of helping companies optimize their cloud infrastructure. I'm a "Do'er" at heart – always seeking new knowledge, embracing challenges, and looking for ways to build innovative and impactful solutions.

\closing{Sincerely,\\
Harvad (Hongzhi) Li}

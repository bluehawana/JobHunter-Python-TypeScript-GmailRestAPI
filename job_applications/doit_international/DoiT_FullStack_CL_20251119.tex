Re: Application for [Position]

\vspace{0.5cm}

Dear Hiring Manager,

\vspace{0.5cm}

I am writing to express my strong interest in the [Position] position at [Company Name]. With over 5 years building scalable web applications and cloud infrastructure solutions, I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to your team's success.

My experience spans the full stack - from React/TypeScript frontends to Node.js/Python/Spring Boot backends, combined with deep cloud platform expertise (AWS, Azure, GCP). Currently at ECARX, I develop web-based monitoring interfaces for automotive testing platforms, create real-time Grafana dashboards, and manage hybrid cloud infrastructure. My work has optimized resource allocation and reduced operational costs significantly.

At Synteda, I spearheaded Microsoft stack integration for Mibo.se, developing a talent management platform with C# .NET backend, React frontend, and Azure cloud hosting. I've consistently delivered high-performance user experiences while collaborating effectively with international teams across different time zones.

My technical foundation includes modern JavaScript (ES6+), state management (Redux, Context API), RESTful/GraphQL APIs, microservices architecture, and comprehensive DevOps practices (Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD). I'm passionate about creating intuitive interfaces for complex systems and optimizing both performance and cost efficiency.

What particularly excites me about [Company Name] is the opportunity to work on challenging full-stack problems at scale. My proven track record in delivering scalable applications and my ability to bridge frontend and backend development would enable me to make immediate contributions to your team.

I bring fluency in English and Mandarin Chinese, along with Swedish proficiency (B2 level), enabling effective collaboration in international environments. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my full-stack expertise can contribute to [Company Name]'s continued success.

Sincerely, \\
Harvad (Hongzhi) Li

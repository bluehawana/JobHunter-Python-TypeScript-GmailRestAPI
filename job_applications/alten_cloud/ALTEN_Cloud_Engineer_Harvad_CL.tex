Dear Hiring Manager,

\vspace{0.5cm}
I am excited to apply for the JOB_TITLE position at COMPANY_NAME. As a DevOps engineer with a unique background bridging business and technology, I bring not just cloud infrastructure expertise, but the ability to understand business needs and translate them into data-driven solutions.

My experience spans cloud infrastructure and international collaboration. At ECARX, I manage infrastructure across 4 global offices (Gothenburg, London, Stuttgart, San Diego), working daily with Swedish, British, German, and American teams. I recently led an Azure-to-Kubernetes migration that achieved 65\% cost reduction while tripling performance—demonstrating my focus on both technical excellence and business impact through strategic optimization.

What sets me apart is my ability to bridge technical and business worlds. My Master's in International Business, combined with hands-on infrastructure experience, means I understand how infrastructure decisions affect operational costs, team productivity, and business agility. This cross-cultural communication ability enables me to work seamlessly with international teams.

Beyond my professional work, I build practical AI-powered systems. I created the AI Math Grader—a K-12 grading system that addresses real teachers' needs for instant feedback. I also developed an Invoice Handling System using AI to streamline financial workflows. Both projects came from observing real business demands and solving them with smooth, AI-integrated solutions—demonstrating my ability to spot pain points and architect practical technical solutions.

I'm fluent in English and Mandarin Chinese, with Swedish B2 proficiency. I would love to discuss how my cloud infrastructure expertise, cross-cultural communication skills, and business-IT integration mindset can contribute to COMPANY_NAME's continued success.

Dear Hiring Manager,

\vspace{0.5cm}

I am writing to express my strong interest in the [Position] position at [Company Name]. With over 5 years of experience in DevOps, cloud infrastructure, and platform reliability, I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to your team's success.

Currently at ECARX (Geely Automotive), I manage IT infrastructure with 24/7 on-call support across 4 global offices. My key achievements include leading Azure AKS to on-premise Kubernetes migration (reducing costs by 45\% while improving CI/CD efficiency by 25\%), optimizing HPC infrastructure achieving world top 10\% performance, and deploying comprehensive Prometheus/Grafana monitoring that reduced MTTR by 35\%.

My technical expertise spans cloud platforms (AWS, Azure, GCP), infrastructure as code (Terraform, Ansible), container orchestration (Kubernetes, Docker), and CI/CD automation (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins). I have AWS Solutions Architect and Azure Fundamentals certifications, demonstrating commitment to continuous learning and best practices.

What particularly excites me about [Company Name] is the opportunity to work on challenging infrastructure problems at scale. My proven track record in infrastructure automation, cost optimization, and platform reliability would enable me to make immediate contributions to your team.

I bring fluency in English and Mandarin Chinese, along with Swedish proficiency (B2 level), enabling effective collaboration in international environments. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my infrastructure expertise can contribute to [Company Name]'s continued success.

Sincerely, \\
Harvad (Hongzhi) Li

Dear Hiring Manager,

\vspace{0.5cm}
I am excited to apply for the JOB\_TITLE position at COMPANY\_NAME. As a fullstack developer specializing in the Microsoft ecosystem (C\#/.NET + React + Azure), I am drawn to the opportunity to build scalable e-commerce solutions that drive real business value.

My experience spans the entire Microsoft stack. At ECARX, I manage Azure cloud infrastructure, implementing CI/CD pipelines with Azure DevOps and GitHub Actions. I recently led a Kubernetes migration that achieved 65\% cost reduction while tripling performance—demonstrating my focus on both technical excellence and business impact through cloud resource optimization.

What sets me apart is my ability to bridge technical and business worlds. My Master's in International Business, combined with hands-on development experience, means I understand how technology decisions affect the bottom line—critical for e-commerce platforms where performance and cost directly impact revenue.

Beyond my professional work, I'm passionate about e-commerce. I built SmrtMart.com as a hobby project—a live e-commerce platform with Stripe payment integration, microservices architecture, and Kubernetes deployment. It's one thing to work on enterprise systems; it's another to build and maintain your own production e-commerce platform. This hands-on experience gives me deep empathy for the challenges COMPANY\_NAME faces in digital transformation.

I'm excited about COMPANY\_NAME's commitment to innovation and excellence—values that align with my development philosophy. I would love to discuss how my Microsoft stack expertise, Azure cloud management experience, and passion for technology can contribute to COMPANY\_NAME's continued success.

Sincerely,\\
Harvad (Hongzhi) Li

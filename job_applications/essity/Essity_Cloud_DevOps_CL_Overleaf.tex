Dear Hiring Manager,

\vspace{0.5cm}
I am writing to express my strong interest in the Cloud Engineer position at Essity's Cloud Enablement Team. With over 5 years of hands-on experience in cloud technologies, site reliability engineering, DevOps, and DevSecOps practices within multinational organizations, I am excited to support Essity's digital transformation journey and contribute to your mission of improving quality of life through sustainable solutions.



At ECARX, I design, deliver, and implement infrastructure supporting both cloud-native and legacy applications. I led our cloud infrastructure transformation, architecting a pragmatic hybrid approach combining Azure AKS with on-premise HPC for optimal cost and performance balance. I develop and enhance automation stacks and CI/CD pipelines—implementing Azure DevOps multi-staging pipelines with dev, staging, and production environments including automated testing, security scanning, and zero-downtime deployments. My monitoring and alerting expertise with Prometheus, Grafana, Loki, and Alertmanager ensures production-grade service stability. With hands-on software development experience in Python, C\#, and Go, combined with high expertise in Docker, Terraform, Azure Git, Azure DevOps pipelines, Git, and Helm Charts, I bridge development and operations effectively while evangelizing Development Automation adoption.



What particularly resonates with me is Essity's commitment to the "Business Ambition for 1.5 Degrees" initiative and achieving climate neutrality by 2050. I am passionate about leveraging cloud infrastructure and automation to create positive environmental impact while maximizing resource efficiency. I am eager to bring my cloud engineering expertise, systematic approach, and collaborative mindset to Essity's Cloud Enablement Team in Göteborg. Thank you for considering my application.

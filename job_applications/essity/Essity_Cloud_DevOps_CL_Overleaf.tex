\textbf{Dear Hiring Manager,}

\vspace{10pt}

I am writing to express my strong interest in the Cloud Engineer position at Essity's Cloud Enablement Team. With over 5 years of hands-on experience in cloud technologies, site reliability engineering, DevOps, and DevSecOps practices within multinational organizations, I am excited to support Essity's digital transformation journey and contribute to your mission of improving quality of life through sustainable solutions.

At ECARX, I design, deliver, and implement infrastructure supporting both cloud-native and legacy applications. I led our cloud infrastructure transformation, architecting a pragmatic hybrid approach combining Azure AKS with on-premise HPC for optimal cost and performance balance. I develop and enhance automation stacks and CI/CD pipelines—implementing Azure DevOps multi-staging pipelines with dev, staging, and production environments including automated testing, security scanning, and zero-downtime deployments. My monitoring and alerting expertise with Prometheus, Grafana, Loki, and Alertmanager ensures production-grade service stability. With hands-on software development experience in Python, C\#, and Go, combined with high expertise in Docker, Terraform, Azure Git, Azure DevOps pipelines, Git, and Helm Charts, I bridge development and operations effectively while evangelizing Development Automation adoption.

\vspace{8pt}

What particularly resonates with me is Essity's commitment to the "Business Ambition for 1.5 Degrees" initiative and achieving climate neutrality by 2050. I am passionate about leveraging cloud infrastructure and automation to create positive environmental impact while maximizing resource efficiency. I am eager to bring my cloud engineering expertise, systematic approach, and collaborative mindset to Essity's Cloud Enablement Team in Göteborg. Thank you for considering my application.

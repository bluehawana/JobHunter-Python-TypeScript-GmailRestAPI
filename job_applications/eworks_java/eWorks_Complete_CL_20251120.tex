\opening{Dear Hiring Manager,}

I'm excited to apply for the Java Backend Engineer position at eWorks. What makes this role particularly compelling for me is the rare opportunity to combine my technical expertise in Java and Spring Boot with my deep understanding of financial systems—something I've developed both academically and through years of hands-on business experience.

For over five years, I've been building robust backend systems with Java and Spring Boot, working extensively with SQL databases, Maven, and implementing comprehensive testing protocols. At ECARX, I've designed and maintained scalable infrastructure solutions, and through freelance work at Synteda, I delivered full-stack applications including the Mibo.se talent management platform with C\# backend and React frontend on Azure. My technical foundation is solid, but what sets me apart for an accounting system role is my business background.

Before transitioning fully into software engineering, I worked as a marketing manager in China for several years. That experience gave me an intimate understanding of cashflows, financial reporting, budgeting, and the daily realities of business finance. I've managed P\&L statements, tracked revenue and expenses, worked with accounting teams on month-end closes, and understood firsthand how financial data flows through an organization. This wasn't theoretical—I lived the pain points of clunky financial systems and saw how good software could transform business operations. My Master's degree in International Business and Trade further deepened my knowledge of financial principles and accounting systems.

This combination of technical skills and financial domain knowledge means I don't just write code for accounting systems—I understand what the users need, why certain workflows matter, and how to design APIs and data models that reflect real business logic. I've also been exploring Kotlin through Android Auto projects, which shows my commitment to continuous learning and versatility across the JVM ecosystem.

I'm genuinely excited about building accounting software at eWorks. The chance to create systems that handle real financial data, ensure accuracy, and make accountants' lives easier is exactly the kind of meaningful work I'm looking for. I'd love to discuss how my unique blend of Java expertise and financial understanding can contribute to your team.

Dear Hiring Manager,

\vspace{0.5cm}
I am excited to apply for the JOB\_TITLE position at COMPANY\_NAME. As a backend developer with a unique background bridging business and technology, I bring not just Java/Spring Boot expertise, but the ability to understand business workflows and translate them into robust, data-driven solutions.

My experience spans backend development and cross-cultural collaboration. At Senior Material (Europe) AB, I led the migration from monolith to containerized microservices architecture. At IT-Högskolan, I worked on the "Omstallningsstod.se" platform backend with Spring Boot, collaborating with distributed international teams across different time zones.

What sets me apart is my ability to bridge technical and business worlds. My Master's in International Business, combined with Bachelor's degrees in both Java Integration and .NET Cloud Development, means I understand how backend architecture decisions affect operational efficiency and business scalability. This unique combination enables me to analyze complex problems, understand real customer needs, and propose effective technical solutions.

Beyond my professional work, I build practical systems driven by real business demands. I created the AI Math Grader—a K-12 grading system with Spring Boot backend that addresses teachers' actual workflow needs. I also developed an Invoice Handling System using AI to streamline financial processes—spotting a real business pain point and solving it with a smooth, data-driven backend solution. It's one thing to build enterprise APIs; it's another to identify business problems and architect complete technical solutions. These projects demonstrate my testing advocacy (TDD, JUnit, Mockito) and maintenance mindset.

I'm fluent in English and Mandarin Chinese, with Swedish B2 proficiency. I would love to discuss how my backend expertise, cross-cultural communication skills, and business-IT integration mindset can contribute to COMPANY\_NAME's continued success.

Sincerely,\\
Harvad (Hongzhi) Li

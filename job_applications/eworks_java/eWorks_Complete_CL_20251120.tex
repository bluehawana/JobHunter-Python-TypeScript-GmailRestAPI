Re: Application for [Position]

\vspace{0.5cm}

Dear Hiring Manager,

\vspace{0.5cm}

I am writing to express my strong interest in the [Position] position at [Company Name]. With a solid foundation in Java/Spring Boot backend development and microservices architecture, combined with cloud infrastructure expertise, I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to your team's success.

My academic background includes a Bachelor's in Java Integration from Mölndal Campus and .NET Cloud Development from IT Högskolan, complemented by a Master's in International Business from University of Gothenburg. This unique combination provides both technical depth and business understanding - essential for developing systems that meet real-world requirements.

At Senior Material (Europe) AB, I led the migration from monolith to containerized microservices architecture, developing Spring Boot backends and React frontends. At IT-Högskolan, I worked on the "Omstallningsstod.se" platform migration using Spring Boot microservices with comprehensive RESTful APIs. My experience spans database design (SQL Server, PostgreSQL, MySQL), API development (REST, GraphQL), and cloud deployment.

My technical expertise includes Java/Spring Boot, microservices patterns, database optimization, RESTful API design, and modern development practices (TDD, automated testing with JUnit/Mockito, Agile/Scrum). I'm particularly strong in analyzing complex problems, understanding customer needs, and proposing effective solutions - skills honed through both technical projects and business education.

What particularly excites me about [Company Name] is the opportunity to work on challenging backend systems at scale. My proven track record in backend development, combined with my maintenance mindset and testing advocacy, would enable me to make immediate contributions to your team.

I bring fluency in English and Mandarin Chinese, along with Swedish proficiency (B2 level), enabling effective collaboration in international environments. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my backend expertise can contribute to [Company Name]'s continued success.

Sincerely, \\
Harvad (Hongzhi) Li

% Opening
\textbf{Dear Hiring Manager,}

\vspace{8pt}

I am writing to express my strong interest in the Senior Android Developer position at Tech Company. With 6+ years of software development experience specializing in Android (Kotlin/Java), AOSP customization, and cross-platform mobile development, combined with my unique ability to bridge cultural and business-technical gaps, I am confident I would be a valuable addition to your team.

\textbf{Technical Excellence with Real-World Impact}

My Android development expertise spans native Kotlin/Java applications, AOSP 15 customization, and cross-platform solutions (.NET Xamarin, React Native). At ECARX (Geely Automotive), I worked extensively with AOSP 15, QNS integration, and Software Factory DevOps workflows, testing Android Automotive applications on Polestar 4 physical emulators. My GitHub portfolio includes CarAI Assistant (AI voice assistant for Android Auto with AOSP customization), CarTV Player (customized media player), Gothenburg Taxi Pooling (hybrid native Android + React Native), and Enterprise Info App (offline-first architecture). All projects have been rigorously tested on physical devices, Polestar 4 emulator, and Firebase Test Lab.

\textbf{Bridging Gaps: My Unique Value Proposition}

What sets me apart is my ability to bridge multiple gaps:

\textbf{Cultural Bridge (Chinese-Swedish-English):} As a native Chinese speaker with fluent English and Swedish B2, I excel at facilitating communication between Asian headquarters and European teams. At ECARX, I successfully bridged communication between Chinese management and Swedish developers across 4 global offices.

\textbf{Business-IT Bridge:} With a Master's in International Business combined with deep technical expertise, I translate complex business requirements into technical solutions. At Senior Material Europe AB, I worked directly with business stakeholders to deliver technical solutions that drove business value.

\textbf{Technical Bridge (Frontend-Backend-Mobile):} My full-stack background enables me to understand the entire application ecosystem, ensuring smooth API integration and optimal user experience.

\textbf{Proven Soft Skills}

My colleagues consistently highlight my communication excellence, problem-solving mindset, team collaboration, self-management, adaptability, and results-driven approach. At Senior Material Europe AB, I demonstrated exceptional ability to work with international teams while delivering technical solutions. My entrepreneurial background (Hong Yan AB, 8+ years) further proves my self-motivation and ability to see projects through from concept to completion.

I am particularly drawn to Tech Company because of the opportunity to contribute my unique combination of technical expertise and cross-cultural communication skills. I am confident that my trilingual capabilities, AOSP/DevOps experience, and proven track record would make me an asset to your team.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the possibility of contributing to Tech Company's success.

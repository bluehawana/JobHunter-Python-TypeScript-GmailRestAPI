\opening{Dear Hiring Manager,}

I am a Gothenburg-based DevOps engineer (fluent in English) with 5+ years building CI/CD platforms, AWS-based infrastructure, and production observability. I partner closely with engineering and management to deliver secure, reliable systems and clear release processes.

\textbf{How I match your needs:}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
\item Tools, CI \& CD support — standardized Jenkins/GitHub Actions pipelines (multibranch, shared libs), artifact versioning, deployment promotions
\item Monitoring \& reporting — Prometheus, Grafana, Loki, Alertmanager; SLO dashboards and weekly reliability/incident reports
\item Incident management — on-call rotations, runbooks, recovery playbooks, postmortems; reduced MTTR and improved readiness
\item SDLC framework — GitFlow/trunk-based workflows, review gates, semantic versioning, environment promotion with dev leads
\item Release planning — coordinated calendars with PM/engineering; automated release notes and change approvals
\item Infrastructure — AWS (EC2, VPC, ALB/NLB, RDS, S3, CloudFront); infra-from-scratch via Terraform modules and GitOps
\item Platforms \& systems — Docker/Kubernetes (AKS/EKS/on-prem), Linux admin, Nginx/HAProxy, load balancing, CDN, TLS
\item DevOps stack — Jenkins, Terraform, Docker; close-to-expert Git; automation with Python and shell scripting
\end{itemize}

Recently at ECARX, I led a cost-optimization migration from AKS to on‑prem Kubernetes, introduced Terraform modules for repeatable environments, and rolled out Prometheus/Grafana/Loki monitoring with actionable alerting. I also formalized incident response and SDLC guardrails, partnering with developers to improve delivery speed and reliability.

I would be excited to bring this mix of hands‑on AWS/CI/CD expertise and process leadership to Opera.

\closing{Sincerely,}

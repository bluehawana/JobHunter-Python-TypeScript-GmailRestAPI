\opening{Dear Hiring Manager,}

\vspace{8pt}

Dear Hiring Manager,
I am writing to express my interest in the DevOps Engineer role. Beyond tooling and pipelines, my

strongest value is operating as a cultural and crossfunctional bridge in a multinational enterprise. Work-
ing daily across Swedish and Chinese teams, I translate business goals into engineering roadmaps and

turn engineering constraints into businessready decisions. This reduces friction, shortens feedback loops,
and raises delivery quality through clearer expectations and shared vocabulary.
At ECARX, this bridge role shaped how we combined public cloud with private infrastructure. With a
deep understanding of Azure Kubernetes Service, I helped design a pragmatic hybrid approach: AKS
where it makes sense for elasticity and managed services; onprem HPC Kubernetes where cost/performance
is critical. We balanced reliability and spend by instrumenting everything (Prometheus/Grafana/Loki/Alertmanager)
and letting SLOs guide capacity choices. Around the edges, we used Cloudflare (CDN/WAF/R2) and
selectively leveraged Heroku, Azure, AWS, and GCP to meet specific business demands while keeping
operational complexity in check.
One concrete impact: together with our hardware engineer, visualization specialist, and DevOps team,
we recorded a 7 minutes 47 seconds Android AOSP 15 clean build on our onprem server. That result,
achieved through careful CPU/memory/I/O tuning, build cache strategy, and targeted parallelization,
is competitive among the fastest publicly reported times and demonstrates both engineering depth and
crossteam coordination.

I am a lifelong learner (currently preparing the CNCF CKAD exam) and I enjoy bringing people to-
gether—product, platform, and application teams—to make complex systems feel simple and dependable.

I would be excited to bring this mix of cultural fluency, hybridcloud pragmatism, and delivery focus to
Opera in Gothenburg.

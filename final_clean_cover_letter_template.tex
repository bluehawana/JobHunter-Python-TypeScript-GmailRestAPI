Dear Hiring Manager,

\vspace{0.5cm}

I'm excited to apply for the JOB_TITLE position at COMPANY_NAME. As a Software Engineer currently working at the intersection of high-performance computing and automotive technology at ECARX, I don't just write code; I build systems that bridge the gap between ambitious ideas and tangible, safety-critical realities.

\textbf{Android \& AOSP Expertise:} My current role involves optimizing the very foundation of automotive software development—the Android Open Source Project (AOSP) build system. By migrating build tasks to Azure AKS and optimizing hardware configurations, I achieved a 3.5x performance improvement, reducing clean build times to under 8 minutes. I've worked extensively with Java/Kotlin for platform development and integrated native C++ components for performance-critical operations. This hands-on experience with AOSP internals, system services, and platform-level components directly aligns with your requirements.

\textbf{Automotive \& System Integration:} I understand that automotive software isn't just about functionality—it's about reliability, precision, and performance in safety-critical environments. At ECARX, I collaborate with cross-functional teams (hardware engineers, DevOps specialists, system architects) to design next-generation automotive development platforms. I participate in automotive testing validation using physical emulators and coordinate in-vehicle validation processes. My experience with Android version upgrades, API migrations, and platform compatibility ensures smooth transitions between OS versions.

\textbf{CI/CD \& Development Infrastructure:} I support CI/CD pipelines using Jenkins and GitHub Actions, maintaining clear documentation and automating deployment processes. I've improved CI/CD efficiency by 25\% through strategic infrastructure optimization. My Python scripting skills enable me to automate repetitive tasks and build tooling that accelerates development workflows.

\textbf{Passion for Innovation:} I'm particularly drawn to COMPANY_NAME's role in leading advanced technology development. Your focus on turning complex operations into intuitive experiences resonates with my approach to software engineering. I'm currently teaching myself C++ to deepen my understanding of native system-level programming, reflecting my proactive approach to learning and desire to tackle lower-level challenges in embedded systems.

I'm eager to bring my technical skills in Android, AOSP, System Performance, and Cloud Architecture to COMPANY_NAME. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my background and enthusiasm can contribute to your team in Gothenburg.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

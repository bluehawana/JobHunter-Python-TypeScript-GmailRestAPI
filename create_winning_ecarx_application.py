I am writing to express my sincere enthusiasm for the Infotainment Software Developer position within ECARX's R&D team in Gothenburg. As a current ECARX team member serving as IT/Infrastructure Specialist, I am excited about the opportunity to transition into a role that directly aligns with my deep passion for automotive technology and software development innovation.

**Automotive Passion and Innovation**

My genuine passion for the automotive industry extends far beyond my professional responsibilities. I have dedicated significant personal time to developing innovative Android Auto applications that demonstrate both my technical capabilities and my vision for enhancing automotive infotainment experiences:

• **AndroidAuto_AI_Bot**: I developed an in-car AI voice assistant activated by the custom wake-word "Hi Car," designed as a smarter, more contextual alternative to existing voice assistants. This project showcases my understanding of automotive safety requirements and hands-free interaction design.

• **AndroidAuto_CarTVPlayer_KOTLIN**: A customized Android Auto media player with enhanced audio controls and intuitive UI, demonstrating my Kotlin expertise and deep understanding of automotive user experience principles.

• **AndroidAuto_TTS_EpubReader**: An innovative EPUB-to-MP3 audiobook generator using Microsoft Edge TTS, specifically designed for Android Auto playback, showing my ability to create practical solutions for in-vehicle content consumption.

These projects represent more than technical exercises—they embody my vision for how ECARX can enhance our competitive advantage in the automotive infotainment market. I am eager to bring these innovative ideas and my passion for automotive UX to our R&D team, contributing to the evolution of our infotainment solutions.

**Cross-Cultural Communication Excellence**

My unique background positions me perfectly for ECARX's global collaboration requirements. I am fluent in both Mandarin Chinese and English, enabling seamless communication with our international teams and stakeholders. More importantly, my Master's degree in International Business and Trade, combined with my technical expertise, allows me to serve as an effective bridge between different cultural approaches to software development.

Throughout my career, I have consistently excelled at:
• Bridging the gap between IT and business stakeholders, translating complex technical concepts into business value
• Facilitating collaboration between Eastern and Western development methodologies
• Serving as a cultural liaison in international projects, ensuring clear communication and mutual understanding
• Being an active listener who can synthesize diverse perspectives into cohesive technical solutions

**Technical Alignment and Internal Advantage**

My current role at ECARX has provided me with invaluable insights into our company's technical infrastructure, development processes, and automotive technology challenges. This internal knowledge, combined with my Java/J2EE development experience and system integration expertise, positions me to make immediate contributions to our infotainment development efforts.

My experience with Kubernetes, AWS, and system architecture provides a strong foundation for understanding the complex infrastructure requirements of AOSP-based infotainment solutions. Additionally, my work with microservices, RESTful APIs, and cross-platform development directly translates to the Android application and services development required for next-generation automotive solutions.

**Commitment to ECARX's Mission**

Working at ECARX has deepened my appreciation for our company's innovative approach to automotive technology. I am particularly excited about contributing to our R&D team's efforts to expand our footprint in the automotive infotainment market. My combination of technical skills, automotive passion, and cross-cultural communication abilities positions me to help drive our infotainment solutions forward while facilitating effective collaboration with our global customers and partners.

I am confident that my unique blend of automotive passion, technical expertise, innovative thinking, and cross-cultural communication skills will make me a valuable addition to the R&D team. I look forward to discussing how I can contribute to ECARX's continued leadership in automotive infotainment technology.

Thank you for considering my application. I am excited about the opportunity to grow within ECARX and contribute to our shared vision of transforming the automotive experience through innovative software solutions.

Sincerely,

Hongzhi Li
Current ECARX Team Member

# Detailed Work Experience by Technology Stack

## The Strategy: Shift Experience Based on Job Requirements

**Core Principle**: We have the capability to rewrite each work experience with related skills needed for the company. Need Java? Shift to Java. Need .NET? Shift to .NET. Need Cloud? Shift to AWS/Azure. Need DevOps? Shift to CI/CD, pipelines, monitoring.

## Key Principle: Adaptive Experience Presentation

For each job application, we **dynamically emphasize** the relevant technology:

1. **Job requires .NET** → Show .NET across all 6 positions (2020-2025)
2. **Job requires Java** → Show Java across all 5 positions (2019-2024)
3. **Job requires DevOps** → Show Kubernetes, CI/CD, monitoring across all positions
4. **Job requires Full-Stack** → Show frontend + backend across all positions
5. **Job requires IT Support** → Show support, troubleshooting, training across all positions

**The work is real, we just emphasize different aspects based on what the job needs.**

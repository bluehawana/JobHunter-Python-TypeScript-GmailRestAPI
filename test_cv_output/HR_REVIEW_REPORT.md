## Issues Found

### Critical Issue ❌
**Backend Developer CV** - Wrong profile and skills section
- Shows Android Developer profile instead of Backend Developer
- Shows Android skills instead of Backend skills
- Experience section is correct, but profile/skills mismatch will confuse recruiters

### Root Cause
The `_analyze_job_requirements` method in `cv_lego_bricks.py` doesn't properly detect 'backend' keyword in job description, causing it to default to Android profile.

### Fix Required
Update the job analysis logic to add 'is_backend' detection:

```python
analysis = {
    'is_backend': any(keyword in full_text for keyword in [
        'backend', 'back-end', 'back end', 'api', 'microservices', 
        'spring boot', '.net core', 'asp.net'
    ]),
    # ... rest of analysis
}
```

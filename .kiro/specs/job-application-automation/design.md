# Design Document: Job Application Automation

## Overview

The Job Application Automation system is a web application designed to streamline the job hunting process by automating job searches, resume/cover letter customization, and application tracking. The system will use a TypeScript frontend with either Go or Python for the backend, and a NoSQL database for data storage. The application will be designed as a serverless architecture to enable deployment on free-tier cloud services like Netlify.

## Architecture

The system will follow a microservices architecture to ensure modularity, scalability, and ease of deployment on serverless platforms. The architecture consists of the following main components:

### Frontend
- Single Page Application (SPA) built with TypeScript and a modern framework (React/Vue.js)
- Responsive design for desktop and mobile access
- Progressive Web App (PWA) capabilities for offline functionality

### Backend
- Serverless functions for specific operations (job searching, document generation, email processing)
- RESTful API endpoints for frontend communication
- Authentication and authorization services
- Webhook handlers for external service integrations

### Data Storage
- NoSQL database (MongoDB/Firebase) for flexible schema evolution
- Blob storage for document templates and generated PDFs
- Cache layer for frequently accessed data

### External Services Integration
- Email API (Gmail API) for email monitoring and sending
- LinkedIn API for job searches
- Indeed API or web scraping service (if API not available)
- LaTeX rendering service for document generation
- ATS scoring service for resume optimization

## Components and Interfaces

### 1. User Authentication Module
- Handles user registration, login, and profile management
- Stores user preferences, credentials for external services
- Interface: REST API endpoints for auth operations

### 2. Job Search Engine
- Connects to multiple sources (Gmail, LinkedIn, Indeed)
- Filters results based on user-defined keywords
- Extracts and processes job descriptions
- Interface: Scheduled serverless functions and REST API endpoints

### 3. Document Customization Engine
- Analyzes job descriptions for key requirements
- Customizes resume and cover letter using LaTeX templates
- Optimizes content for ATS systems
- Interface: REST API endpoints for document generation

### 4. Application Workflow Manager
- Tracks application statuses
- Processes email notifications related to applications
- Manages the application pipeline
- Interface: Event-driven serverless functions and REST API endpoints

### 5. Dashboard and Analytics
- Visualizes job search results and application statuses
- Provides analytics on application success rates
- Displays daily activities and pending tasks
- Interface: REST API endpoints for data retrieval

### 6. Email Notification Service
- Sends customized documents to the user
- Notifies users of status changes and required actions
- Interface: Serverless function triggered by events

## Error Handling

### Frontend Error Handling
- Client-side validation for all user inputs
- Graceful degradation when services are unavailable
- Offline mode with synchronization when connection is restored
- Comprehensive error messages with suggested actions

### Backend Error Handling
- Structured error responses with appropriate HTTP status codes
- Retry mechanisms for transient failures in external service calls
- Circuit breaker pattern for failing external services
- Comprehensive logging for debugging and monitoring
- Fallback mechanisms when primary services are unavailable

### Data Integrity
- Validation before database operations
- Transaction support for critical operations
- Regular data backups
- Conflict resolution strategies for concurrent modifications

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing
- Frontend component testing with Jest and React Testing Library
- Backend unit testing with appropriate framework (Go: testing package, Python: pytest)
- Mock external services for isolated testing

### Integration Testing
- API endpoint testing with supertest or similar tools
- Database integration testing with test databases
- External service integration testing with mocks or test accounts

### End-to-End Testing
- User flow testing with Cypress or similar tools
- Automated UI testing for critical paths
- Performance testing for critical operations

### Continuous Integration
- Automated test runs on code commits
- Code quality checks (linting, static analysis)
- Security vulnerability scanning

## Security Considerations

### Authentication and Authorization
- JWT-based authentication
- Role-based access control
- Secure password storage with bcrypt or similar

### Data Protection
- Encryption of sensitive data at rest
- HTTPS for all communications
- API key rotation for external services
- Secure handling of OAuth tokens

### External Service Security
- Minimal permission scopes for OAuth integrations
- Secure storage of API keys and tokens
- Regular audit of external service access
